#EASY# <center><h2> Nearest two 2 powers</h2> </center>

Given an integer N, find the nearest powers of 2, such that one of them is less than or equal to N, and the other greater than N, and there are no other power of 2 in between them.



INPUT:

First line of the input contains an integer T, T test cases follow. (1 <= T <= 10000)

Each test case contains a 64 bit integer N. (1 <= N <= 2<sup>63</sup>-1)



OUTPUT:

For each test case, output one line 

A B

[A is followed by a 'space', then by B, and finally by a '\n']
where,

A = 2<sup>x</sup>, and
B = 2<sup>x+1</sup>

such that A <= N < B, N being the i<sup>th</sup> test case input, 1 <= i <= T



EXAMPLE:

Input:

4
10
255
264024874276943
1024

Output:

8 16
128 256
140737488355328 281474976710656
1024 2048



EXPLANATION:

(test cases 1):
10
nearest powers of 2 for 10 are
8 and 16

Therfore output:
8 16

(test case 4):
1024
nearest powers of 2 for 1024 are
512, 1024, 2048
since N itself is 1024, choose the next higher power, i.e 2048

Therfore output:
1024 2048
